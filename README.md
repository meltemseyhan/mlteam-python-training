# Python and OpenAI Training by MLTeam

## Overview

This project is developed for people who are experienced in software engineering, but new to Pyhthon and OpenAI.

This project is based on the content of a course in Udemy called [5-in-1 Mega Course: Python, Javascript, React JS, CSS, AI](https://deliveryhero.udemy.com/course/python-ai-crashcourse/learn/lecture/41713364#overview). If you want to spend more time or rather prefer to watch videos while learning, you can also take this course. Here we do not cover the Web part of the course.

In the root folder you will find two jupiter notebooks [^1], which cover all the concepts, structs and syntax of Python. If you have a limited time, looking for a fast-track way of learning Python, you can just use these notebooks to understand and play around with them, instead of taking days of courses, watching hours of videos. 

* [python_basics.ipynb](./python_basics.ipynb):
    * Variables
    * If statements
    * Functions
    * Packages / modules
    * Loops
    * Tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries
* [python_advanced.ipynb](./python_advanced.ipynb)
    * Classes, encapsulation, inheritence, polymorphism
    * Http requests, JSON
    * Error handling
    * With statement
    * Enumeration
    * Dotenv
    * List comprehension

Apart from these noteboooks, you will also find a sample application called 'vocal assistant', you will learn much more when you play around with it. For the details of 'vocal-assistant', please refer to its [readme file](./vocal-assistant/README.md)

## Prerequisites
1. Pyhton: You need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to your operating system. This project is tested in Python 3.12.1.
    * Remember to add Python to your PATH. In mac, you can do so by running 'Update Shell Profile.command' in your Python folder.
    * You can check if the installation is succesful by running `python3 --version` command in your terminal/shell. 
2. You will need an editor to run the notebooks.
    * You can install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
    * Once VS Code is installed, you will also need to install [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

[^1]: A notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. A notebook, along with an editor (like JupyterLab or VS Code with Python extension), provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.
